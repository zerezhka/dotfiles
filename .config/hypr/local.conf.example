# PC-specific Hyprland configuration example
# This file should be copied to ~/.config/hypr/local.conf (NOT in the repo)
#
# Setup on new system:
#   cp ~/Projects/dotfiles/.config/hypr/local.conf.example ~/.config/hypr/local.conf
#   # Edit ~/.config/hypr/local.conf with your monitor setup
#
# Note: local.conf lives in ~/.config/hypr/ (outside repo) so it persists
# across git operations and is truly machine-specific

# Monitor setup examples:
# Single monitor:
# monitor=,preferred,auto,1

# Dual monitors side by side:
# monitor=HDMI-A-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1
# monitor=HDMI-A-2,1920x1080@60,1920x0,1

# Laptop with external monitor:
# monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1
# monitor=HDMI-A-1,1920x1080@60,1920x0,1

# Workspace assignments (optional):
# workspace=1,monitor:HDMI-A-1
# workspace=2,monitor:HDMI-A-1
# workspace=6,monitor:HDMI-A-2
# workspace=7,monitor:HDMI-A-2
